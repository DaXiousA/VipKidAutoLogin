# vipkidAutoLogin
auto login and register class Python 3 script at vipkid.com.cn

Warning: Because of rcent API changes at Vipkid.com.cn, the script is no longer working. Need some minor changes! I will look at it when I got time. You are welcome to modify it yourself.

libs needed:
Requests  http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
PIL       http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.x/

To Start:

1. download autologin/main.py
2. find login section (starting at line 130), input your username & passwd and class (teacher) you want to register
3. run main.py
4. class registered

This is a test version. Bugs may happen.
